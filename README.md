### Introduction
In this Project we will be using 2 Machine Learning Algorithms.

1 - We will be using classification trees to distinguish the make of a car given certain features. We will test this using a decision tree and a Random Forest to see which gives the best results.

2 - We will create a neural network that will classify a picture of a number between 0-9 correctly.
